#Doge-Teroids
Doge-teroids is a whimsical adaptation of the classic Atari game Asteroids.  The live version on the project can be viewed [here](http://www.johnochs.io/doge.html).  Controls for moving the ship are `ASDW and `SPACE to fire.

##Implementation
Most of Doge-teroids is implemented in JavaScript.  Prototypal inheritance is used to keep objects dry.  The entire Doge-teroids game is namespaced as `Asteroids.
